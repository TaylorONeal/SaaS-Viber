## How to Use

### If you're starting from scratch

1. Read `FEATURE_REFERENCE.md` to understand what most SaaS apps need
2. Open `ROADMAP.md` and replace placeholders with your features
3. Use `COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md` to understand your market position

### If you already have a product

1. Use `FEATURE_REFERENCE.md` as a gap-check — are you missing anything obvious?
2. Fill in `ROADMAP.md` with your current and planned features
3. Run a `COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS.md` to find your positioning

### With an AI agent

```
Read docs/roadmap/FEATURE_REFERENCE.md and docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md.

My product is [DESCRIBE]. Select relevant features from the reference,
add my domain-specific features, and generate a filled-in roadmap with
priorities, timelines, and success metrics.
```
