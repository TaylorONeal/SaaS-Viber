## Opportunity Identification

### Gaps in the Market

Look for patterns across competitors to find opportunities:

| Gap Type | Description | Opportunity |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Feature gap** | Something no competitor does well | Build the best version of this |
| **Audience gap** | An underserved segment | Target this niche specifically |
| **Price gap** | A tier no one offers | Fill the price/value gap |
| **Experience gap** | Poor UX across the board | Win on design and usability |
| **Integration gap** | Missing key integrations | Build the connectors others lack |
| **Support gap** | Everyone has poor support | Win on customer experience |
| **Platform gap** | Missing mobile, API, etc. | Build where others haven't |

### Positioning Matrix

Plot competitors on a 2x2 matrix. Choose two dimensions that matter to your audience:

```
                    High [Dimension A]
                         |
                         |
    [Quadrant 2]         |         [Quadrant 1]
                         |
  Low [Dimension B] -----+------ High [Dimension B]
                         |
    [Quadrant 3]         |         [Quadrant 4]
                         |
                    Low [Dimension A]
```

Example dimensions to plot:
- Ease of use vs Feature depth
- Price vs Capability
- SMB focus vs Enterprise focus
- Self-serve vs Sales-led
- Vertical specific vs Horizontal

### Your Positioning Statement

```
For [target audience]
Who [need/pain point]
Our product is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [main competitor]
We [key differentiator]
```
