# License Selection Guide

Choosing the right license for your SaaS product is an important decision that affects how others can use, modify, and distribute your code. This file serves as both a guide and a placeholder -- once you've chosen your license, replace the guide section with your actual license text.

## Common SaaS License Options

### MIT License
**Best for:** Open source projects that want maximum adoption.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Permissions** | Commercial use, modification, distribution, private use |
| **Conditions** | License and copyright notice must be included |
| **Limitations** | No liability, no warranty |
| **Pros** | Maximum adoption, simplest to understand, widely recognized |
| **Cons** | No patent protection, anyone can compete with your code |

**When to use:** You want maximum community growth and don't mind competitors using your code.

---

### Apache License 2.0
**Best for:** Open source projects that need patent protection.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Permissions** | Commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, private use |
| **Conditions** | License and copyright notice, state changes, include NOTICE file |
| **Limitations** | No liability, no warranty, no trademark use |
| **Pros** | Patent protection, widely understood, corporate-friendly |
| **Cons** | More complex than MIT, requires NOTICE file |

**When to use:** You're building something with patentable technology and want to protect contributors.

### AGPL-3.0 (Affero General Public License)
**Best for:** SaaS products that want to prevent proprietary forks.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Permissions** | Commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, private use |
| **Conditions** | Disclose source, license and copyright notice, same license, state changes, **network use is distribution** |
| **Limitations** | No liability, no warranty |
| **Pros** | Strongest copyleft -- even network use requires source disclosure |
| **Cons** | Scares away some enterprise users, limits commercial adoption |

**When to use:** You want to ensure that anyone who runs a modified version of your software as a service must also open-source their modifications.

---

### BSL 1.1 (Business Source License)
**Best for:** Companies that want time-delayed open source.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Permissions** | Source available immediately, becomes open source after a defined period |
| **Conditions** | Non-production use is free, production use requires a license (until the change date) |
| **Limitations** | Production use is restricted until the change date |
| **Pros** | Source is visible (builds trust), prevents competitors from self-hosting, becomes open source over time |
| **Cons** | Not OSI-approved, may confuse some users, requires defining "production use" |

**When to use:** You want source transparency but need to monetize your hosted version. Used by Sentry, MariaDB, CockroachDB, and others.

---

### Proprietary / All Rights Reserved
**Best for:** Closed-source commercial SaaS.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Permissions** | Only what you explicitly grant |
| **Conditions** | Users agree to your Terms of Service |
| **Limitations** | No redistribution, no modification, no reverse engineering |
| **Pros** | Maximum control, clear commercial model |
| **Cons** | No community contributions, less trust, harder to hire (engineers can't see your code) |

**When to use:** Your business value is in the code itself and you have no interest in open source.

---

### Dual License
**Best for:** Projects that want open source community AND commercial revenue.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Structure** | Open source license (e.g., AGPL) + commercial license for enterprises |
| **Permissions** | Community users get AGPL; paying customers get a permissive commercial license |
| **Pros** | Best of both worlds -- community growth and commercial revenue |
| **Cons** | Complex to manage, requires CLA (Contributor License Agreement) |

**When to use:** You want a thriving open source community but also need enterprise customers who won't accept copyleft terms.

## Recommendations by SaaS Model

| SaaS Model | Recommended License | Why |
|-------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Open source tool** | MIT or Apache 2.0 | Maximum adoption |
| **Open core** (free + paid features) | AGPL or BSL for core, proprietary for premium | Protects your competitive advantage |
| **Source-available** | BSL 1.1 | Transparency without free-riding |
| **Closed source** | Proprietary | Full control |
| **Developer tool** | Dual (AGPL + Commercial) | Community growth + enterprise revenue |
| **B2B platform** | Proprietary or BSL | Enterprise customers expect it |
