# Open Source Resources

> *These files are for projects that choose to be open source. If your SaaS is proprietary, you can ignore this folder or delete it.*

If you decide to open source your project (fully or partially), these templates will help you set up proper community governance and contribution processes.

## When to Open Source
- You want community contributions
- You want to build trust and transparency
- Your business model doesn't depend on code secrecy (e.g., you monetize hosting, support, or premium features)
- You want to attract developer talent

## When NOT to Open Source
- Your competitive advantage IS the code
- You're not ready to manage a community
- You have proprietary algorithms or trade secrets in the codebase

## Files in This Folder
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Contribution guidelines template
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Community standards template
- `SECURITY.md` — Security vulnerability reporting template
- `GOVERNANCE.md` — Project governance model template

## How to Use
1. Copy the files you need to the root of your repository
2. Fill in the bracketed placeholders
3. Review and customize for your project's needs
